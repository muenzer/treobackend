    "description": "*New for 2016*\n\nThe Intro to Clay Class has been extended to four weeks to give each student more time on the potters wheel. \n\nDuring the first two weeks you will be introduced to the pottery wheel and try throwing your own pots. You will also begin to work on a hand building projects of your choice. The last two weeks will focus on finish work, you will trim and glaze your pots. Finished work will be available for pick up 1 to 2 weeks after the class' conclusion. \n\nThis class is geared to adults and teenagers age 13 and up.\n\n(Since space is very limited, we request a 50CHF deposit to reserve a spot.  After registration, we will send an email with payment info.)  \nMax. 5 participants.\n\nThe class fee includes all materials, including up to 1 kg of clay, glaze and firing. \n\nDepending on space availability and student interest, classes may be held in conjunction with Open Clay sessions. Intro to Clay participants are welcome to stay for the full three hour session.",
